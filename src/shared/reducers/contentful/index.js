/**
 * Root reducer for `contentful` segment of Redux store. This segment contains
 * two sub-segments, `preview` and `published`; they have exactly the same inner
 * structure, the only difference is:
 *
 *  - `preview` sub-segment holds information fetched from Contentful Preview
 *    API: the latest versions of content, not necessarily published for public.
 *
 *  - `published` sub-segment holds information fetched from Contentful Content
 *    Delivery API, which returns published content, that is visible to general
 *    public. Thus, this content might be behind, or the same, as the version
 *    from `preview`.
 *
 * This reducer just filters out incoming actions related to its segment, and
 * routes them between `preview` and `published` sub-segments, based on the
 * presence of boolean `preview` field in the action payload objects.
