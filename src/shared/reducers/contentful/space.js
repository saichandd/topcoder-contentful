/**
 * This reducer manages segments of Redux store that hold data related to a
 * single Contentful space, visible either in regular, or `preview` mode.
 * It is up to the parent reducers to properly route actions so that this
 * reducer recieves actions only related to the proper space / mode. As this
 * reducer concerns, in a space there are `assets`, and `entries`, and each
 * incoming action requires some manipulations on them. It just routes incoming
 * actions between corresponing `assets` and `entries` sub-segments, depending
 * on the value of `target` field in the action payload objects; and also
 * does some extra processing for query done actions, because in addition to
 * the query results (found content), they also include additional information
 * on the assets/entries linked from the returned content, which should be
 * stored as well.
