Code-splitting + server rendering
        </h3>
        <p>
We’ve tried and failed a couple of times. What we learned:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You need synchronous module resolution on the server so you can
            get those bundles in the initial render.
          </li>
          <li>
            You need to load all the bundles in the client that were involved
            in the server render before rendering so that the client render
            is the same as the server render. (The trickiest part, I think
            its possible but this is where I gave up.)
          </li>
          <li>
            You need asynchronous resolution for the rest of the client app’s
            life.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We determined that google was indexing our sites well
          enough for our needs without server rendering, so we dropped it
          in favor of code-splitting + service worker caching. Godspeed
          those who attempt the server-rendered, code-split apps.
