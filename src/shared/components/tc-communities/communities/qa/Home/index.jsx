        <p>
          One of the key drivers of Digital Transformation within large
          organizations is the mass consumerization of technology. In the brave
          new ‘connected’ world, organizations are forced to adopt new
          technologies to keep pace with the digitalization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing is also part of this transformation and plays a critical role
          in the organization’s business strategy. It bears striking similarity
          to the ‘pit stop’ paradigm in Formula One racing. The modern pit stop
          is a fascinating choreography of technology execution and efficiency
          that separates the winners from the crowd. This is very similar to
          how we see Quality Engineering in the new world. The nirvana state of
          driving ‘Zero Cost of Quality’ which was the primary goal of
          Enterprise IT of yesteryear, has progressively transformed to drive
          ‘Quality at zero impedance’.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are on the look-out for individuals who can run our ‘pit stops’ as
          we move to our next orbits of growth. So what are you waiting for?
          Come join us, the world’s best QA community!
