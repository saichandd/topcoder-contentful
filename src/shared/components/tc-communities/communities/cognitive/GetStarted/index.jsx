            The Topcoder Cognitive Community is free to join — no strings
            attached. Winning submissions receive financial prizes, which vary
            by challenge. Leading challenge winners are also eligible to win a
            trip to the Topcoder Open to compete live. All that, and some of
            our most talented developers have gone on to work for companies
            like IBM and Google or even start their own businesses. What are
            you waiting for?
