              Before you can compete in challenge, you need to sign up for
              Topcoder. It’s free and easy to get started right away. Once you
              complete your Topcoder registration, we will also ask you to
              verify that you are currently in the service or reserves, or have
              been honorably discharged.

              There are three main tracks: design, development, and data science.
              Whether you’re looking to design a landing page, solve a coding
              problem, or submit a winning algorithm, there’s a challenge for you.

Getting Paid

              With Topcoder, you get paid for winning challenges, not for hours
              worked. The reward varies for each challenge — from checkpoint to
              final round — but you’ll always know in advance of competing.
