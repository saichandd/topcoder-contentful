Why We Started
          </h1>
          <p>
            The U.S. military has some of the most sophisticated technology
            platforms and equipment on the planet, which demand the brightest
            minds available. And with 200,000 service members exiting the
            military annually, it’s time to apply that expertise to civilian
            employment with thousands of organizations around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the transition from military to civilian life can be
            challenging and, as with any training, the most effective method
            includes real-world experience. Yet, there are few private sector
            programs outside the realm of government service that effectively
            and repeatedly provide new, realistic opportunities for service
            members. In fact, the Center for New American Security reports that
            60% of employers see the translation gap as the biggest obstacle to
            bringing more vets on board.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re here to bridge that gap.

            a 503(c) dedicated to helping veterans learn to code. Together with
            our partners, we have developed a coalition of companies that share
            our vision and are committed to providing job opportunities to
            members of the Topcoder Veterans Community.
